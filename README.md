# START Project

The START project aims to develop a mobile, modular, open-source platform for early detection of autism risk by non-specialist health workers in low-resource settings.

## Field Study Results
Results from the field study in India using the app are available:
- [Autism Risk Detection in Low-Resource Settings](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13623613231182801)
- [Individual Component Results 1](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265587)

The code for the START app is available for free on GitHub: [START Repository](https://github.com/Manishyadav514/START).

## Project Overview
The initial phase of the project was supported by the [Medical Research Council UK](http://www.mrc.ac.uk) Global Challenge Research Fund and focused on India. The START platform uses a combination of parent reports and direct child assessments to detect autism risk in children aged 2-5 years. The tablet-based assessment includes several small tests, questionnaires, and observations, briefly described [here](/overview).

## Integration with STREAM
START is now part of the [STREAM platform](https://research.reading.ac.uk/stream), which assesses different domains of neurodevelopment in children between the ages of 0 and 6 years in India and Malawi.
