                The START project is the result of a collaboration between

                India Institutes of Medical Sciences, Sangath, Indian Institute
                of Technology Bombay and Therapy BoxÂ®. This project is funded by
                a{" "}
                <strong>Global Challenge Research Fund Foundation Award</strong>{" "}
                by the <em>Medical Research Council UK</em>. START is a
                scalable, modular and extensible mobile platform that will be
                used to collect parent report and direct child assessment to
                help detect probable cases of <em>ASD</em> in children aged 2-5
                years. Children with <em>ASD</em> on average take longer to
                disengage attention from prior stimuli, and do not prefer{" "}
                <em>social stimuli</em> (e.g. <strong>faces</strong>,{" "}
                <strong>voices</strong>, <strong>gestures</strong>) over
                non-social ones. The app will build on this knowledge and
                include assessments for different sensory, perceptual and
                social-behavioural aspects of autism.{" "}
                <strong>Eye-tracking</strong>, a promising technology for
                assessing <em>ASD</em> risk, will be used to measure overt
                attention as indexed by gaze, while behavioural responses will
                be recorded via touchscreen.
